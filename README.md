# inventory
The inventory and purchase ordering system we created provides a plethora of features any organization with multiple branches would need to track and manage their inventory. We have 3 roles; branch manager, purchasing manager, warehouse manager. The system is capable of handling an unlimited number of users, products, and branches. Users are able to track their orders with status updates and email notifications that are automatically sent out. The user interface is clean and intuitive where users would not need a manual to operate the system.
Using mpdf and php mailer we were able to generate purchase order pdfs and email them to the suppliers directly from the system.
